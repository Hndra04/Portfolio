# Portfolio

# Description
This is a self-initiated project where I built a portfolio website using React.js and Tailwind CSS. The site is designed to showcase my work in machine learning and AI, highlighting key projects, skills, and accomplishments. It features a clean, responsive design, optimized for both desktop and mobile users.
